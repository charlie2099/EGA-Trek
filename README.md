# EGA-Trek Reimagined 
> Captain, the enemy have invaded our space and begun a number of simultaneous attacks focused
> on the Starbases we have across the sector. We believe they've deliberately done this to
> stretch our forces and reduce the strength of our response. WE must go to their defence, we
> can not let the people of our federation suffer! Unfortunately, much of the fleet is combating
> the enemy in different regions, for this mission you're own your own. Admiral out!
